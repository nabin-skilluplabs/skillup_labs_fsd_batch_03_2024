        <p>Parallel mechanism design is in general a difficult problem. It consists of interactively solving two tightly coupled
            problems: <code>(i) mechanism synthesis and (ii) dimensional
            optimization.</code> Over the last two decades or so, we have
            witnessed the enormous progresses toward the second problem, namely for a given mechanism the kinematic (forward,
            inverse and instantaneous)([1],[2],[3])</p>
