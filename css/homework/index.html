                <li>
                    <h3 class="nbg">04. Programming with JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript is the programming language that powers the modern web. In this course, you will learn the basic concepts of web development with JavaScript. You will work with functions, objects, arrays, variables, data types, the HTML DOM, and much more. You will learn how to use JavaScript and discover interactive possibilities with modern JavaScript technologies. Finally, you will learn about the practice of testing code and how to write a unit test using Jest.</p>

You’ll examine different types of React components, learn various characteristics and when to use them. You’ll start working with hooks, effects and other functional components. You’ll find out how routing is used in React to customize the users’ experience, you’ll create a web application that consumes API data, and you’ll get familiar with the most commonly used React framework integrations, tools, and debugging approaches.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="nbg">06. Principles of UX/UI Design</h3>
                    <p>Learn the fundamentals of User Experience (UX) research and design. Become immersed in the UX process of identifying problems and iterating and testing designs to find appropriate solutions. You’ll learn how to empathize with users through best-practice research approaches, and create common UX artifacts such as user personas.
