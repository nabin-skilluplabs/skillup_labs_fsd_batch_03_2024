    <h2>Pensioner Concession Card holders</h2>
    <p>If you hold a NSW Pensioner Concession Card you're entitled to free registration for one vehicle where you are recorded as the registered operator. You may also be eligible for automatic registration renewal (not applicable for conditional registrations). Visit Automatic rego renewal for pensioners to learn more.</p>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>If you meet certain eligibility criteria, you can renew your vehicle's registration online.    </p>
    <p>
        While renewing you may be able to make changes to details like your usage type and the registration term.
    </p>
    <p>If you want to change the term, you must have bought compulsory third party (CTP) insurance for the same term. A change in registration term may also affect the inspection requirements.    </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> When renewing a conditional registration (non-standard vehicle) online:</p>
