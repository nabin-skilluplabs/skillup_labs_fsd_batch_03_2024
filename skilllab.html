You will take a first look at the core technologies of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and explore the concepts that underpin how the internet works. You will learn how full-stack developers create websites and applications that work well and are easy to maintain.</td>
            <td>Learn how modern software developers collaborate across the world without messing up each other’s code. You will look at the different version control systems and how to create an effective software development workflow. You will be introduced to some of the most commonly used Linux commands that you can use to work with files on your hard drive and create powerful workflows that will automate your work, saving you time and effort.</td>
            <td>In this course, you'll use software development tools like HTML to build attractive web pages that work well—and you’ll use structured semantic data to control how websites appear to the end user. You will then dive deeper into CSS by applying increasingly specific styling to various elements. You’ll learn to use Bootstrap’s grid system to create layouts and work with components and themes. Finally, you'll explore debugging and learn how it can be utilized to banish common front-end errors.</td>

You will learn how to use JavaScript and discover interactive possibilities with modern JavaScript technologies. Finally, you will learn about the practice of testing code and how to write a unit test using Jest.</td>
            <td>Learn how to use more advanced React concepts and features, optimize and debug your React applications, and become proficient in using React Bootstrap and JSX. You’ll examine different types of React components, learn various characteristics and when to use them. You’ll start working with hooks, effects and other functional components. You’ll find out how routing is used in React to customize the users’ experience, you’ll create a web application that consumes API data, and you’ll get familiar with the most commonly used React framework integrations, tools, and debugging approaches.</td>
            <td>Learn the fundamentals of User Experience (UX) research and design. Become immersed in the UX process of identifying problems and iterating and testing designs to find appropriate solutions. You’ll learn how to empathize with users through best-practice research approaches, and create common UX artifacts such as user personas.

You’ll also learn to distinguish between different types of database management systems. You’ll then practice basic creation and data selection tasks with the use of Structured Query Language (SQL) commands. Back-end developers write applications that end-users use to interact with databases. Some common tasks that end-users carry out using these applications include storing, searching, extracting and manipulating data.</td>
            <td>In this course you’ll learn how can you optimize processor time with Node.js? Discover how Node.js operates in a non-blocking manner and how to handle the result from a network call. Explore the advantages and challenges associated with using anonymous callback functions. Use Node.js to parse JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data from a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) message.</td>
            <td>In this course you’ll learn that when you use Node.js to build a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) server, you will discover that the default Node.js framework is low-level. You can extend its features with third-party packages such as Express. Get hands-on experience with the Express web application framework by creating a web server that listens to incoming requests. You also learn how to implement authorization with Express. Use routing, middleware, and template rendering to extend the Node.js framework and handle dynamic content.</td>
