            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Suraj Neupane, an aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for building robust and user-friendly web applications.</p>
            <p>As I embark on my journey into the world of software development, I'm thrilled to explore the ins and outs of both front-end and back-end technologies. From crafting intuitive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to designing efficient server-side architectures with frameworks like Node.js and Django, I'm eager to immerse myself in every aspect of the development process.</p>
            <p>I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and collaborate with fellow developers. Whether it's tackling new coding challenges, experimenting with emerging technologies, or contributing to exciting projects, I'm always ready to dive in and expand my skills.</p>
            <p>Let's connect and share our experiences in the world of full-stack development â€“ I'm excited to learn and grow together!</p>
